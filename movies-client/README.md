# movies-client

This is the front-end for the Movies app. It runs on Vue and Foundation.

This application was created using Node version 18.12.1. It is possible it'll work on older Node versions, but I can't promise that.

## Running the application

Open a terminal in the same folder as this README, and run "npm run dev".
Open the url from the terminal. Make sure the back-end is also running, otherwise the application won't work.
The application expects the back-end to use port 7285. If you are running the back-end on a different port, change it in .\helpers\http.js
